# Cold Storage Availability Project

## Overview
The Cold Storage Availability project is a comprehensive platform designed to educate farmers about cold storage techniques to maximize crop preservation and reduce post-harvest losses. The platform offers practical classes, resources, and information about cold storage technologies specifically tailored for agricultural needs.

## Project Structure
This repository contains two main components:

1. **Static HTML Website** - A fully functional website with information about cold storage classes and techniques
2. **React Application** - A modern React implementation of the same platform (in development)

## Features

- **Educational Resources** - Comprehensive information about cold storage techniques for various crops
- **Class Registration** - Information about upcoming classes with registration options
- **Crop-Specific Techniques** - Specialized knowledge for different types of produce and farming conditions
- **Maintenance Guides** - Instructions on how to maintain and troubleshoot cold storage facilities
- **Energy Efficiency Tips** - Methods to reduce energy costs while maintaining optimal storage conditions
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface accessible on all devices

## Technologies Used

### Static Website
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome (for icons)

### React Application
